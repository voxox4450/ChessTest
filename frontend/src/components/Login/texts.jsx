            <h3>Information about the research</h3>

            <p>You are invited to take part in a research study which aims to investigate different strategies for learning chess/solving chess-related tasks. We are conducting this research as the Students&rsquo; Union PRAGMA project. This study has been reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of Management and Social Communication at Jagiellonian University. Please take the time to read the following instructions carefully. If anything is unclear or you would like more information, contact the researchers.</p>

            <h4>What will happen?</h4>

            <p>Over the course of two weeks, you will participate in five learning sessions and complete a final test. There must be at least one day break (24h) between each session. Once the break ends, you will have another 24 hours to start your next session. Each learning session and final test will take approximately 1 hour.</p>

            <p>This link will remain the same throughout the learning sessions. Reminders to complete sessions will also be sent via email.</p>

            <p>After completing all learning sessions, you will receive an email with access to the final test. Afterwards, you will also receive a survey to fill out after completing the test.</p>

            <h4>Participant rights</h4>

            <p>Your participation is voluntary and you are free to leave the study at any point without explanation and without any of your medical, social care, education, or legal rights being affected. You have the right to omit or refuse to answer or respond to any question that is asked of you. You have the right to ask that any data you have supplied to that point be withdrawn/destroyed.</p>

            <p>If you wish to withdraw from the study during the experiment, please notify the experimenters via the email address provided at the end of this message within one week of your participation, quoting your e-mail address to request the withdrawal of your data. After the final test, data may be withdrawn from the study up until the point that the data collection period has completed and the data have been anonymised and collated. After this date it will no longer be possible to remove your data but nor will it be possible to identify it or link it to you.</p>

            <p>There are no known benefits or risks beyond everyday life for you in this study.</p>

            <h4>Compensation</h4>

Additionally, by participating in the study, you have a chance to win a 50 USD Amazon voucher. Prizes will be awarded through a random draw among participants who complete the experiment.</p>

            <h4>Confidentiality</h4>

            <p>The data you provide will be identified by a participant number and will not be linked to identifying information you have supplied. During the data collection period, your data will be stored securely on password-protected computers. The data will only be accessed by the researchers and supervisor named below the information and will not be shared with any other organisations.</p>

            <h4>What will happen with my data?</h4>

            <p>We will be using information from you in order to undertake this study and will act as the data controller for this study.

Jagiellonian University will keep identifiable information about you for week after the study has finished. Anonymised data will be held for 7 years following completion of the study.

Jagiellonian University has in place policies and procedures to keep your data safe. This data may also be used for future research following review and approval by an independent Research Ethics Committee.</p>

            <h4>What will happen to the results of the study?</h4>

            <p>The results of this study will be reported journal publications and conference presentations. The project does not involve or report comparisons or evaluations of individuals; the results will be reported anonymously. Anonymised data will be submitted to journals.</p>
